So my partner was struggling to kick out some villagers in their Animal Crossign New Horizons island.

They followed an strategy that was basically checking out every villager to see which one has a thought bubble.
They also had to keep count of how many days passed without a bubble, or without a new visit in the campfire.

To help them accomplish it, I made this little tool with the icons of their villagers.

You can visit it on its [GitHub Page](https://brisaabrasadora.github.io/acnh-villagers-tracking/)
## How to use it
The idea is simple: you see your villager in-game, and if it doesn't have any thought bubble, you click or tap on its icon
on the tool, and keep going. If anybody has it, add one to the counter on the left. Additionaly, if nobody came to the campfire
that day, you add one to the counter on the right.

## Some things to consider
You can use it on the phone too, since it has a mobile version too.

This tool doesn't save any kind of data, not even cache. So any refresh would reset the counters and the villagers markdowns.
It's a really simple tool that I made quickly, and my partner was happy it was useful, and so was I.
